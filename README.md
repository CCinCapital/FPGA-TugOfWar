# FPGA-TugOfWar
The Tug of War game contains 3 push buttons, 1 switch, 7 LEDs, and 1 FPGA.
It was my third year course ELEC3500 Lab Project.
Team Size: Two.

### About the Game
Two Players play against each other on a Xilinx FPGA development board.

### Game Flow:
Each Round:
    </br> 1. all the LEDs should come on for a second and then go off.
        This is the get ready signal.
    </br> 2. After a random time the middle LED comes on again.
        Then each player will try to push his button before the other player does.
    </br> 3. The position of the lit LED will move toward the fastest button pusher.
